# _Airspace_ for Hugo
![screenshot](https://github.com/themefisher/airspace-hugo/raw/master/images/screenshot.png "Home of the website")

Airspace is a clean, unique, and free bootstrap website template, contributed to the community by [Themefisher]. Built with refined business as well as corporate elements, and saturated with rich typography, Airspace is lightweight, fast-loading, responsive and W3C-validated, delivering a great first impression to visitors.

Airspace uses HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and the [Twitter Bootstrap 3 framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), assuring the best viewing experience on major web browsers including IE9/IE10/IE11, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, for any screen sizes of desktop and mobile devices.

And now, Airspace has been ported to [Hugo] thanks to the great work of Giacomo Mariani (@karjudev)!
Giacomo was inspired by the [Jekyll port](https://github.com/ndrewtl/airspace-jekyll) by Andrew Lee (@ndrewtl).
